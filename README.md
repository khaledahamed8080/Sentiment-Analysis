# Sentiment-Analysis

This repo contains tutorials covering understanding and implementing sequence classification models using PyTorch, with Python 3.9. Specifically, we'll train models to predict sentiment from movie reviews.

*1.Neural Bag of Words
This repo covers the workflow of a sequence classification project with PyTorch. We'll cover the basics of sequence classification using a simple, but effective, neural bag-of-words model, and how to use the datasets/torchtext libaries to simplify data loading/preprocessing.

*2.Recurrent Neural Network
Now we have the basic sequence classification workflow covered, this repo will focus on improving our results by switching to a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. We'll do the  implementation of the long short-term memory (LSTM) RNN, one of the most common variants of RNN.

*3.Transformer-(Bert)
Finally, we'll see how to use the transformers library to load a pre-trained transformer model, specifically the BERT model from this paper, and use it for sequence classification.
